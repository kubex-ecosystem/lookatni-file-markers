## Plano de emergência

- **Se sentir inseguro logo no começo**
*"While I can communicate in English, I don’t have daily conversation practice, so sometimes I need an extra second to express an idea. That’s why I’ve been taking structured speaking lessons to improve my fluency, and I’m already seeing progress."*

- **Se travar no meio da resposta**
*"Sorry, I just need a quick moment to phrase this correctly — English is not my first language, but I’m actively improving it. I prefer to take a second rather than give you the wrong answer."*

- **Se perguntarem sobre o idioma diretamente**
*"I believe communication is key, and that’s why I’m investing in my English speaking skills through a dedicated course. I’m confident my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities will allow me to deliver results while I continue improving my fluency."*
