# VS Code Extension

UI-focused workflows built on the Core library.

## Highlights

- Extract, Generate, Validate â€” using the Core for parity
- Status bar + Explorer view + visual markers
- Works in untrusted workspaces (limited operations)

## Commands

- LookAtni: Extract Files
- LookAtni: Generate Markers
- LookAtni: Validate Markers
- LookAtni: Quick Demo

Tip: Build the Core first (`cd core && npm run build`) so the extension can import it.
