Experience LookAtni in action:

1. **Open Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. **Type**: `LookAtni: Quick Demo`
3. **Press Enter** and watch the magic happen!

This creates a sample HTML project and demonstrates the complete workflow.

### Step 2: Generate Markers from Your Project

Transform your existing project into portable markers:

1. **Open your project** in VS Code
2. **Command Palette** ‚Üí `LookAtni: Generate Markers`
3. **Select source folder** (your project root)
4. **Choose output file** (e.g., `my-project-markers.txt`)
5. **Configure options** (file filters, size limits)
6. **Generate!** ‚ú®

### Step 3: Extract Markers Anywhere

Restore your project from markers:

1. **Get your markers file** (`.txt` file from Step 2)
2. **Command Palette** ‚Üí `LookAtni: Extract Files`
3. **Select markers file**
4. **Choose destination folder**
5. **Extract!** Your project is restored perfectly

## Real-World Example

Let's create a React project marker:

### Create Sample React Project

```bash
# Create a simple React component
mkdir my-react-app
cd my-react-app

# Create package.json
echo '{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0"
  }
}' > package.json

# Create a component
mkdir src
echo 'import React from "react";

export function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello LookAtni!</h1>
      <p>This project was packaged with LookAtni File Markers</p>
    </div>
  );
}' > src/App.jsx
```

### Generate Markers

1. **Open** `my-react-app` in VS Code
2. **Command Palette** ‚Üí `LookAtni: Generate Markers`
3. **Source**: `./` (current folder)
4. **Output**: `react-app-markers.txt`
5. **Exclude**: `node_modules` (default)
6. **Generate!**

### Share and Extract

Your `react-app-markers.txt` file contains everything:

```
//‚êú/ package.json /‚êú//
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0"
  }
}

//‚êú/ src/App.jsx /‚êú//
import React from "react";

export function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello LookAtni!</h1>
      <p>This project was packaged with LookAtni File Markers</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Anyone can now extract this into a working React project!

2. **Generate markers** for distribution
3. **Students extract** and follow along
4. **Include in course materials**

### Backup Workflow

1. **Generate markers** for important projects
2. **Store markers files** in cloud storage
3. **Extract when needed** for recovery
4. **Version control** your markers

## Tips for Success

### File Organization

- **Use descriptive names** for markers files
- **Include version numbers** (e.g., `project-v1.2-markers.txt`)
- **Add date stamps** for time-based tracking
- **Organize by project type** or purpose

### Best Practices

- **Exclude large files** (videos, binaries, dependencies)
- **Use size limits** to keep markers manageable
- **Validate regularly** to catch issues early
- **Document your markers** with comments

### Performance Tips

- **Generate incrementally** for large projects
- **Use file filters** to focus on relevant code
- **Split large projects** into logical markers
- **Monitor file sizes** and optimize as needed
